 Setup Instructions:
Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv env
Activate the environment:
Windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost

 Results::
The model uses XGBoost with RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² are calculated, and actual vs predicted sales plots are generated.
